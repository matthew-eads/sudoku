Sudoku
======
C++ implementation of a sudoku solver, with various heuristics.

The sudoku solver reads in sudoku files of sizes 9x9, 16x16, or 25x25
It allows for different heuristics to be used - simply edit the #define's
in sudoku.cpp, and recompile using make. 

The algorithms and results are discussed in more detail in sudoku.pdf

Many features of this solver were provided by Prof. Anself Blumer (the
solver was an assignment for his AI class)
